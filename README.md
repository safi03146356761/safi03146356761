Hi, My name is Safi Ur Rehman. I am a Professional Web Application Developer having experties in 
FRONT-END Tools such as HTML, CSS, Boostrap, WordPress, JavaScript(Angular JS,React JS) and JQuery
and BACK-END Tools such as SQL, MySql, PHP-Core, CodeIgniter, Laravel and Ruby On Rails. 

I believe in some says which are listed below.....

1) First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
2) Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
3) Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
4) Programming isn't about what we know; it's about what we can figure out.

Thanks & Regards:
Safi Ur Rehman
